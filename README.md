Nowadays the word Gamification has been spread out through multiples industry sectors promising benefits in the organizations like better productivity and higher incomes.
But first of all, what is Gamification?
Well, Gamification is a mindset that transform the way we work by three different ways:
	- Fostering a culture of learning.
	- Encouraging employees who are doing tough or repetitive tasks.
	- Recognizing employees who are going beyond their job descriptions.
	
	
So, with that briefly description of Gamification, we are proud to introduce Ayni. A new way to gamify Continuous Delivery powered by DevOps.
	
Ayni is inspired in the ancient Inkas culture, where the community was formed by families (Ayllus) and they worked helping each other (Ayni) to accomplish a common goal. This goal was to protect their lands, feed the community and some others.

Ayni is formed by five main concepts:
	- Ayllu
	- Runa
	- Waka
	- Quri
	- Tambo
		
With these main concepts we can have several Ayllus inside an organization, each of them with different number of Runas (people). The Ayllus will be on charge of one or more Wakas (territory or products).
